# Python

This project was completed as a deep dive into analysis using Python during my data analytics boot camp. I completed an analysis of customer, product, and order data to derive insights and discover strategies. The goal, if it was a project in the real world, was to provide insight to the Instacart team in decision making for marketing and sales techniques in the future. For this project, I used Python (with tools such as Pandas) and Excel.
